# 1-Bit Commitment 
The following is an optimized form of a bit commitment as described in the BitVM whitepaper. It uses fewer opcodes and it's simpler since it doesn't require the unlocking script to provide the bit's value. 

You can test this script by pasting it into [Script Wiz](https://ide.scriptwiz.app).

## Locking Script 
```
OP_HASH160
OP_DUP

<0xf592e757267b7f307324f1e78b34472f8b6f46f3>    // This is hash1
OP_EQUAL
OP_DUP

OP_ROT
<0x100b9f19ebd537fdc371fa1367d7ccc802dc2524>    // This is hash0
OP_EQUAL

OP_BOOLOR
OP_VERIFY

// Now the value of the bit commitment is on the stack. Either "0" or "1".
```

## Unlocking Script 

Case `value = 0`, this is preimage0
```
<0xfa7fa5b1dea37d71a0b841967f6a3b119dbea140>
```
Case `value = 1`, this is preimage1
```
<0x47c31e611a3bd2f3a7a42207613046703fa27496>
```
